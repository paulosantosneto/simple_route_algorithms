# simple_route_algorithms
This repository contains applications of breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), greedy, A* and dijkstra search algorithms in a simplified version of the cities of Rio Grande do Sul, a Brazilian state. 

## About the map:

Many simplifications were made both in the number of cities, as in the routes between them.
Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants were preferably chosen, as well as those not so close or in the same micro-region.
